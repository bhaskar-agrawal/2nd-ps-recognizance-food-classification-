# 2nd-ps-recognizance-food-classification-
This ML model is based on oversampling data for making class distributiion almost equal in training dataset. Oversampling was done using data augmentation , first all the images were converted to numpy array using some sort of script in 224,224,3 size.
Then using data augmentation more data was added. At last vggnet type architecture was used to create the model,accuracy was quite less almost 62%, I really need to work on data to improve accuracy.
